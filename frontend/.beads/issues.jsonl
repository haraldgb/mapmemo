Prefer manual decode to avoid touching shared config.\n- Zoom to fit both routes (they likely overlap mostly, with the player's detour visible)\n- This map can reuse the GMap component or create a simpler map instance for display-only\n\nRIGHT PANEL — STATS:\n- Player's route time: formatted as \"X min Y sec\" from RouteResult.playerRouteTimeSeconds\n- Optimal route time: formatted same\n- Time difference: formatted, highlighted if significant (e.g., red if \u003e 2x optimal)\n- Time spent playing: from formattedTime prop (wall clock time from useGameTimer)\n- Play again button: calls onPlayAgain prop\n\nAPI CALLS ON MOUNT:\n- When this component mounts, it needs to compute the RouteResult\n- Call computeRouteResult(startAddress, endAddress, playerPath) from api/computeRoutes.ts\n- Show a loading state while the API calls are in flight\n- Store the result in local state\n- Handle errors: if the API fails, show an error message but still show the play again button\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- The component receives raw game data and handles its own API calls.

Add a conditional branch:\n   ```tsx\n   if (mode === 'route') {\n     return \u003cRouteGame /\u003e   // new component (see below)\n   }\n   // ... existing click/name mode code unchanged\n   ```\n   \n   The route mode branch renders a completely separate component because route mode shares almost nothing with click/name mode (no polygons, no GeoJSON, no feature styles).\n\nCREATE NEW FILE: game/route/RouteGame.tsx\n   This is the top-level route mode component (equivalent to Game.tsx's body for click/name mode).\n   \n   ```tsx\n   export const RouteGame = () =\u003e {\n     const { seed, mode } = useSelector((state: RootState) =\u003e state.mapmemo.gameSettings)\n     \n     // Route mode hooks\n     const routeState = useRouteMode(seed)\n     const timer = useGameTimer({ isRunning: routeState.isGameActive \u0026\u0026 !routeState.isComplete })\n     \n     // Map interaction handlers\n     const handleIntersectionClick = (intersection: RoadIntersection) =\u003e {\n       routeState.handleIntersectionClick(intersection)\n     }\n     const handleDestinationClick = () =\u003e { /* mark complete */ }\n     \n     // Reset (play again)\n     const handlePlayAgain = () =\u003e {\n       dispatch(setGameSettings({ ...gameSettings, seed: randomSeed() }))\n       routeState.reset()\n       timer.resetTimer()\n     }\n     \n     // Results screen\n     if (routeState.isComplete) {\n       return \u003cRouteResults\n         startAddress={routeState.startAddress}\n         endAddress={routeState.endAddress}\n         playerPath={routeState.path}\n         elapsedMs={timer.elapsedMs}\n         formattedTime={timer.formattedTime}\n         onPlayAgain={handlePlayAgain}\n       /\u003e\n     }\n     \n     // Gameplay screen\n     return (\n       \u003csection className={s_section}\u003e\n         \u003cGMap\n           spinUntilReady\n           features={[]}         // no GeoJSON features for route mode\n           onMapReady={handleMapReady}\n         \u003e\n           {isMapReady \u0026\u0026 (\n             \u003c\u003e\n               \u003cRouteGameHUD\n                 routeState={routeState}\n                 formattedTime={timer.formattedTime}\n               /\u003e\n               \u003cGameSettingsButton /\u003e\n             \u003c/\u003e\n           )}\n         \u003c/GMap\u003e\n       \u003c/section\u003e\n     )\n   }\n   ```\n   \n   NOTE: GMap accepts features=[] for route mode. Route mode uses direct map objects (markers, polylines) managed by useRouteMapRendering, not the GMap data layer. The GMap component still provides the map instance and spinner.\n\n2. game/Game.tsx — MODE BRANCH\n   Add the import and early return for route mode at the top of the component:\n   ```tsx\n   const mode = useSelector((state: RootState) =\u003e state.mapmemo.gameSettings.mode)\n   if (mode === 'route') return \u003cRouteGame /\u003e\n   ```\n   This keeps the existing Game.tsx logic completely untouched for click/name mode.\n\n3. game/route/RouteGameHUD.tsx — NEW FILE\n   Route-specific HUD component. Simpler than the main GameHUD:\n   - Timer (left) — same display as click/name mode\n   - Prompt text (center):\n     - isLoading → \"Loading route...\"\n     - path.length === 0 → \"Click an intersection to start navigating\"\n     - isDestinationReachable → \"Click the destination to finish!\"\n     - otherwise → \"Navigate towards [endAddress.name]\"\n   - No score (route mode doesn't have correct/incorrect counts during gameplay)\n   - Same visual style as existing GameHUD (same Tailwind classes, same positioning)\n\nIMPORTANT INTEGRATION NOTES:\n- GMap.tsx currently wires up feature click/hover listeners. For route mode with features=[], these are effectively no-ops. Route mode click handling is done through AdvancedMarkerElement click listeners in useRouteMapRendering.\n- The useRouteMapRendering hook needs the map instance from GMap's onMapReady callback. Wire this through state in RouteGame (same pattern as existing Game.tsx with isGMapReady).\n- Timer starts when isGameActive becomes true (first intersection click) and stops when isComplete (destination reached).\n- The seed-based reset (play again) generates a new seed and re-initializes. This may give the same addresses (only 2 in the list) but could swap A/B.\n- GameSettingsButton should still work in route mode — it opens the settings panel where the player can change settings.\n- Do NOT modify useGame.ts, useGameState.ts, useGameStyling.ts, or useFeaturesInPlay.ts. Route mode is a completely separate branch, not integrated into the existing hooks.\n\nVALIDATION:\n- Selecting route mode in settings and entering the game shows the route mode UI\n- Spinner appears while loading, disappears when road data + addresses are ready\n- HUD shows timer and prompt text\n- Full gameplay loop works: see dots → click dots → route builds → reach destination → results screen\n- Play again resets everything\n- Settings button opens settings panel\n- Switching back to click/name mode still works correctly\n- No regressions in click/name mode behavior","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"haraldgb@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:51:32.671854+08:00","created_by":"Harald","updated_at":"2026-02-21T09:51:32.671854+08:00","labels":["route-mode-v3"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.11","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:51:32.6735574+08:00","created_by":"Harald"},{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.11","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi.9","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:51:32.6758728+08:00","created_by":"Harald"},{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.11","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi.10","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:51:32.6769374+08:00","created_by":"Harald"},{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.11","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:51:32.6785398+08:00","created_by":"Harald"}]}
{"id":"frontend-odi.2","title":"Define route-specific types","description":"Define all types needed by route mode. These are referenced by every subsequent route mode bead.\n\nCREATE NEW FILE: game/route/types.ts\n\nTypes to define:\n\n1. RouteAddress — a start/end address definition (no lat/lng — those come from Snap to Roads API at runtime)\n   ```ts\n   type RouteAddress = {\n     name: string      // e.g. \"Jacob Aalls gate 32\"\n     roadName: string  // e.g. \"Jacob Aalls gate\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. SnappedAddress — a RouteAddress after geocoding + road-snapping\n   ```ts\n   type SnappedAddress = RouteAddress \u0026 {\n     lat: number\n     lng: number\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. SelectedIntersection — a single player decision (one click)\n   ```ts\n   type SelectedIntersection = {\n     intersectionId: number\n     lat: number\n     lng: number\n     fromRoadName: string   // road the player was on when clicking\n     toRoadName: string     // road the player entered (may be same road if continuing straight)\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. RouteGameState — the core mutable game state (NOT a discriminated union — game phase is derived from this data)\n   ```ts\n   type RouteGameState = {\n     startAddress: SnappedAddress\n     endAddress: SnappedAddress\n     currentRoadName: string\n     currentIntersectionId: number | null  // null = on starting road, haven't clicked yet\n     path: SelectedIntersection[]          // ordered clicks; undo = pop (not implemented in v1)\n   }\n   ```\n   Game phase derivation:\n   - `path.length === 0` → at start (show starting road intersections)\n   - destination road reachable from current intersection → show end marker as clickable\n   - otherwise → mid-route\n\n5. RouteResult — computed after game ends, from Google Maps Compute Routes API\n   ```ts\n   type RouteResult = {\n     playerRouteTimeSeconds: number\n     optimalRouteTimeSeconds: number\n     differenceSeconds: number\n     playerRoutePolyline: string   // encoded polyline from Compute Routes response\n     optimalRoutePolyline: string  // encoded polyline from Compute Routes response\n   }\n   ```\n\nIMPORTANT DESIGN NOTES:\n- RouteAddress intentionally has NO lat/lng. The spec says coordinates are fetched at runtime via Snap to Roads API. SnappedAddress is the resolved version.\n- The path array is append-only in v1 (no undo). But its design (ordered array with pop semantics) makes undo trivial to add later.\n- Do NOT create a discriminated union state machine for game phases. The issue spec explicitly says \"All game phases are derived\" from the data.

Geocode the address string to get approximate lat/lng\n2. Snap that lat/lng to the nearest road via Google Maps Roads API (Snap to Roads)\n\nSTEP 1 — GEOCODING:\n- Use the Google Maps Geocoding API (REST): `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=\u003caddress\u003e,+Oslo,+Norway\u0026key=\u003ckey\u003e`\n- OR use the Places API (already loaded in GoogleMapsProvider as 'places' library) via `google.maps.places.PlacesService` or the newer `Place.searchByText()`\n- The REST approach is simpler and doesn't require a map instance. Prefer REST.\n- API key: use `fetchGoogleMapsApiKey()` from `utils/googleMapsApiKey.ts` (already memoized)\n\nSTEP 2 — SNAP TO ROADS:\n- Google Maps Roads API endpoint: `https://roads.googleapis.com/v1/snapToRoads?path=\u003clat\u003e,\u003clng\u003e\u0026key=\u003ckey\u003e`\n- Takes the geocoded lat/lng and returns the nearest point on the road network\n- Response includes `snappedPoints[0].location.latitude` and `.longitude`\n- If the Roads API is not available or fails, fall back to the geocoded coordinates (they're usually close enough for marker placement)\n\nFUNCTION SIGNATURE:\n```ts\nexport const resolveAddress = async (address: RouteAddress): Promise\u003cSnappedAddress\u003e\n```\n\nTakes a RouteAddress, returns a SnappedAddress with lat/lng populated.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Both APIs use the same API key as the Maps JS API (fetched via fetchGoogleMapsApiKey)\n- Use fetchWithSessionRetry from game/hooks/useFeaturesInPlay.ts for the REST calls (handles 401 session retry). NOTE: fetchWithSessionRetry is currently in a hook file — import it directly, it's a standalone async function despite its location.\n- Add `credentials: 'include'` to fetch calls for session cookies\n- The Roads API (Snap to Roads) requires the \"Roads API\" to be enabled in the Google Cloud project. If it returns a 403/permission error, document this clearly in the error message so the developer knows to enable it.\n- Handle errors gracefully: if geocoding fails, throw with a clear message. If snap-to-roads fails, fall back to geocoded coordinates.\n\nVALIDATION:\n- Calling resolveAddress({ name: \"Jacob Aalls gate 32\", roadName: \"Jacob Aalls gate\" }) returns a SnappedAddress with valid Oslo coordinates (approximately lat: 59.93, lng: 10.73)\n- The returned coordinates are on or very near the actual road","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"haraldgb@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:46:15.1632918+08:00","created_by":"Harald","updated_at":"2026-02-21T09:46:15.1632918+08:00","labels":["route-mode-v3"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.4","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:46:15.1643983+08:00","created_by":"Harald"},{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.4","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:46:15.1654928+08:00","created_by":"Harald"}]}

ROAD CACHE: A Map\u003cstring, RoadInfo\u003e that accumulates ALL road data received from the API.\n   - The API response for a single road query returns that road PLUS all roads branching from its intersections (pre-fetched for responsiveness).\n   - So a single fetch populates multiple entries in the cache.\n\n2. FETCHED ROADS TRACKING: A Set\u003cstring\u003e that tracks which roads have been fetched as the PRIMARY query target (i.e., the road_name param in the API call).\n   - A road appearing as a BRANCH in another road's response does NOT count as fetched.\n   - WHY: The branch data only includes intersections with the queried road. To get a road's FULL intersection list (all its intersections with all other roads), you must fetch it as the primary target.\n   - This distinction is critical for correct gameplay: when the player enters a new road, ALWAYS fetch it as primary target even if it's already partially in the cache from a branch response.\n\n3. FETCH FUNCTION:\n   ```ts\n   const fetchRoad = async (roadName: string) =\u003e {\n     if (fetchedRoads.has(roadName)) return  // already fetched as primary\n     setIsLoading(true)\n     const response = await fetchRoadWithIntersections('Oslo, Norway', roadName)\n     // response is Record\u003cstring, RoadInfo\u003e — merge ALL entries into roadCache\n     // add roadName to fetchedRoads set\n     setIsLoading(false)\n   }\n   ```\n   Uses fetchRoadWithIntersections from api/roadData.ts (already exists).\n\n4.

[]\n   }\n   ```\n\nSTATE MANAGEMENT:\n- Use useState for roadCache (Map) and fetchedRoads (Set). When updating, create new Map/Set instances to trigger re-renders.\n- isLoading tracks in-flight fetches. If multiple fetches are concurrent, isLoading stays true until all complete.\n- reset() clears both roadCache and fetchedRoads, sets isLoading to false.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Do NOT use useMemo/useCallback — React Compiler handles memoization automatically (per project CLAUDE.md).\n- The hook does NOT trigger any fetches on its own. The consumer (useRouteMode) calls fetchRoad() when needed.\n- Error handling: if a fetch fails, log the error and leave the cache unchanged. Don't crash the game.\n- The RoadInfo and RoadIntersection types are imported from api/roadData.ts (already defined there).\n\nVALIDATION:\n- After fetchRoad(\"Jacob Aalls gate\"), roadCache contains \"Jacob Aalls gate\" plus branching roads\n- fetchedRoads contains only \"Jacob Aalls gate\" (not the branches)\n- Calling fetchRoad(\"Jacob Aalls gate\") again is a no-op (already in fetchedRoads)\n- getIntersectionsForRoad returns the correct intersection list\n- reset() clears everything","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"haraldgb@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:47:57.5630733+08:00","created_by":"Harald","updated_at":"2026-02-21T09:47:57.5630733+08:00","labels":["route-mode-v3"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.7","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:47:57.563655+08:00","created_by":"Harald"},{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.7","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:47:57.5653161+08:00","created_by":"Harald"}]}

UPDATE POSITION:\n   - If intersection.otherRoadName === currentRoadName: player is continuing on the same road, just moved to a new intersection\n     - currentIntersectionId = intersection.id\n   - If intersection.otherRoadName !== currentRoadName: player is turning onto a new road\n     - currentRoadName = intersection.otherRoadName\n     - currentIntersectionId = intersection.id\n     - Trigger: roadGraph.fetchRoad(intersection.otherRoadName) — fetch the new road's full data\n\n3. CHECK FOR COMPLETION:\n   - After updating position, check if the destination is now reachable\n   - Destination is reachable when: the end address's roadName appears as an otherRoadName in one of the intersections at the current position\n   - When reachable, the destination marker becomes clickable (handled by the map rendering bead)\n   - If the player clicks the destination marker, isComplete = true\n\nAVAILABLE INTERSECTIONS (derived state):\n- When currentIntersectionId is null (at start): return ALL intersections of the starting road\n- When currentIntersectionId is set: return intersections reachable from that position\n  - This means: all intersections of currentRoadName that are \"ahead\" of the current position (direction committed)\n  - PLUS: all intersections of connected roads at the current intersection (i.e., the player can see intersections down connecting roads, not just the next one)\n\nDIRECTION COMMITMENT:\n- When the player clicks an intersection, they commit to a direction on the current road.\n- Intersections \"behind\" the selected intersection (on the same road) disappear from available choices.\n- \"Behind\" is determined by the intersection's position relative to the last clicked intersection along the road's intersection list.\n- Implementation approach: filter the current road's intersections to only those between the current position and the road's endpoints (in the direction of travel). The exact definition of \"ahead\" vs \"behind\" can use the intersection order in the RoadInfo.intersections array, or geographic distance. The intersection array order from the API may not be geographically ordered — investigate this. If not ordered, use geographic proximity to determine direction.\n\nEND DETECTION:\n- At each position, check all intersections reachable from currentIntersectionId\n- For each intersection, check if its otherRoadName === endAddress.roadName\n- If yes, the destination road is reachable — mark it so the map rendering can show the end marker as clickable\n- Expose a derived boolean: `isDestinationReachable` — true when the player can see/click the destination\n\nRESET:\n- Clear path, reset currentRoadName/currentIntersectionId to null\n- Call roadGraph.reset()\n- Re-run initialization with the same seed (or accept a new seed)\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Do NOT store game phase as explicit state. Derive it: `path.length === 0` → start, `isComplete` → end, otherwise → mid-route. This is per the spec.\n- The hook reads the seed from its parameter. The consumer gets the seed from Redux gameSettings.\n- useEffect for initialization should be a named function (per project coding standards).\n- Error handling: if address resolution or initial road fetch fails, set an error state and surface it. Don't silently fail.\n- This hook is complex. Keep it well-organized: initialization logic, click handler, derived state computations, each in clear sections.\n\nVALIDATION:\n- On mount with a valid seed, isLoading transitions from true → false after init completes\n- startAddress and endAddress are populated with lat/lng\n- availableIntersections returns the starting road's intersections initially\n- Clicking an intersection updates path, currentRoadName, currentIntersectionId\n- After clicking, intersections behind the player disappear from availableIntersections\n- When destination road is reachable from current position, isDestinationReachable is true\n- reset() returns everything to initial loading state","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"haraldgb@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:49:09.7174978+08:00","created_by":"Harald","updated_at":"2026-02-21T09:49:09.7174978+08:00","labels":["route-mode-v3"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.8","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:49:09.7185559+08:00","created_by":"Harald"},{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.8","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:49:09.7201677+08:00","created_by":"Harald"},{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.8","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi.6","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:49:09.7212228+08:00","created_by":"Harald"},{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.8","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi.7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:49:09.7228069+08:00","created_by":"Harald"}]}

INITIAL ZOOM:\n   - After initial data loads (startAddress + endAddress + starting road intersections are all available):\n   - Compute bounds that fit: startAddress, endAddress, AND all starting road intersection points\n   - Call map.fitBounds(bounds) with some padding\n   - After this initial fit, the player can freely pan/zoom (don't re-fit on subsequent interactions)\n\nMAP OBJECT LIFECYCLE:\n- Use useEffect (named functions per project standards) to sync map objects with state\n- When routeState changes, diff the visual state:\n  - Add new dot markers for new available intersections\n  - Remove dot markers for intersections no longer available\n  - Update polyline path\n  - Update end marker clickability\n- On unmount / reset: clean up all markers and polylines (remove from map, clear references)\n- Keep references to all created map objects so they can be updated/removed. Use a Map\u003cnumber, AdvancedMarkerElement\u003e keyed by intersectionId for dots.\n\nSPINNER:\n- The map should be hidden behind a spinner until routeState.isLoading is false AND initial zoom is set\n- This matches the existing pattern in Game.tsx where GMap has spinUntilReady\n- isMapReady should be true once initial rendering is complete\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- AdvancedMarkerElement is passed in (from GMap's onMapReady callback). Use it for all markers.\n- google.maps.Polyline is available from the core Maps JS API (no extra library needed).\n- For dot hover effects: use CSS transitions on the custom HTML element inside AdvancedMarkerElement. The element is a regular DOM element, so standard CSS works.\n- Do NOT use the map.data layer (that's for GeoJSON polygons used by click/name mode). Route mode uses direct markers + polylines.\n- This hook will need the map instance. The consumer (Game.tsx route branch) gets it from GMap's onMapReady callback.\n\nVALIDATION:\n- A and B markers appear at correct positions on game start\n- Starting road's intersections appear as white dots\n- Hovering a dot makes it expand\n- Clicking a dot turns it blue and triggers onIntersectionClick\n- Blue polyline extends through selected intersections\n- Dots behind the player disappear after clicking\n- When destination is reachable, B marker changes visual state\n- Initial zoom shows A, B, and all starting intersections in view\n- All markers/polylines are cleaned up on reset","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"haraldgb@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:50:08.8645073+08:00","created_by":"Harald","updated_at":"2026-02-21T09:50:08.8645073+08:00","labels":["route-mode-v3"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.9","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:50:08.8656396+08:00","created_by":"Harald"},{"issue_id":"frontend-odi.9","depends_on_id":"frontend-odi.8","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-21T09:50:08.8672257+08:00","created_by":"Harald"}]}
