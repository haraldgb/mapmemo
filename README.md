# MapMemo

MapMemo is an attempt at a game for memorizing places of interest within cities. The idea came from realizing I never really learn the layout of where I live when I use Google Maps all the time.

## Project layout

- `frontend/`: Vite + React app (see `frontend/README.md` for setup and env vars).
