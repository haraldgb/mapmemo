# MapMemo

MapMemo is an attempt at a game for memorizing places of interest within cities. The idea came from realizing I never really learn the layout of where I live when I use Google Maps all the time.

## Disclaimer

This project is built largely with the help of AI. During an initial phase of exploring the maps API and getting a POC up and running, some quality aspects of the code are left to be cleaned up later.
